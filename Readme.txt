ProjectAI1

This project is focused on exploring the concepts and technologies behind Large Language Models (LLMs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs). The goal is to experiment with these areas, understand their capabilities, and learn how they can be combined or used individually.

Areas of Exploration:
- LLMs for natural language processing tasks
- AI and ML techniques for data analysis and automation
- RAGs for enhancing LLMs with external information

This project is experimental and intended for learning and prototyping.
- LLM-based text generation and analysis.
- Custom ML models for data preprocessing or postprocessing.
- RAG implementation for knowledge-augmented responses.

Requirements and setup instructions will be added as the project develops.
Thankyou.
